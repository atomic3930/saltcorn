The event type for triggers determines when the chosen action should be run. 
The different event types options come from a variety of the types and sources.

These events also form the basis of the event log. Use the log settings to enable or disable 
recording of the occurrence of events.

## Database events

These conditions are triggered by changes to rows in tables. Together with the event type 
a specific table is chosen. The individual conditions are:

**Insert**: run the action when a new row is inserted in the table. This is a good choice
when a table itself represents actions to be carried out; for instance a table of 
outbound emails would have a trigger with When = Insert and Action = send_email

**Update**: run this action when changes are made to an existing row. The old row can 
be accessed with the `old_row` variable.

**Delete**: run this action when a row is deleted

## Periodic events

These triggers are run periodically at different times.

**Weekly**: run this once a week.

**Daily**: run this once a day.

**Hourly**: run this once an hour.

**Often**: run this every 5 minutes.

## User-based events

**PageLoad**: run this whenever a page or view is loaded. If you set up the event log to 
record these events you can use this as a basis for an analytics system.

**Login**: run this whenever a user log in successfully

**LoginFailed**: run this whenever a user login failed

**UserVerified**: run this when a user is verified, if an appropriate module for 
user verification is enabled.

## System-based events

**Error**: run this whenever an error occurs

**Startup**: run this whenever this saltcorn process initializes.Â 

## Other events

**Never**: this trigger is never run on its own. However triggers that are marked as never
can be chosen as the target action for a button in the UI. Use this if you have a complex 
configuration for an action that needs to be run in response to a button click, or if you
have a configuration that needs to be reused between two different buttons in two different 
views. You can also use this to switch off a trigger that is running on a different event 
type without deleting it.

**API call**: this trigger can be run in response to an inbound API call. To see the URL 
and further help, click the help icon next to the "API call" label in the trigger list.

## Custom events

You can create your own event type which can then be triggered with an emit_event action 
or the `emitEvent` call in a run js code action

## Events supplied by modules

Modules can provide new event types. For instance the mqtt module provides an event 
type based on receiving new messages.
